I found that there's no Lua Torch version so that I created one. I tried as much as i can to translate from gnu octave to lua torch, please raise issue if you found anythings weird or awkward. Thanks.

## Pre-requisites
- [Install Torch7](http://torch.ch/docs/getting-started.html#_)

- `luarocks` install following rocks
    - matio
    - lpeg
    - distributions
    - paths
    - torchx
    - unsup
    - svm

## Run exercise
Exercise 1 as an example.

```shell
cd src/machine-learning-ex1/ex1
th ex1.lua
```

## Enjoy!
Please let me know if anything went wrong.
